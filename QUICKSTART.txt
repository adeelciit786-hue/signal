## 💰 Risk Management

### Example: BTC at $88,702
```
Current Price: $88,702
ATR: $800

For BUY:
✓ Entry: $88,702
✓ Stop Loss: $88,702 - (800 × 2) = $87,102
✓ Take Profit: $88,702 + (800 × 4) = $92,902
✓ Risk: $1,600 | Reward: $4,200 | Ratio: 1:2.6

Position Size (2% risk, $10,000 account):
  = ($200 risk) / ($1,600 per position)
  = 0.125 lots
```
